It is designed for creating network-centric applications. 
It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement 
because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.

Why to Learn Javascript
Javascript is a MUST for students and working professionals to 
become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. 
I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Javascript:

Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and 
that makes it a programmer’s great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, 
it helps you developing great front-end as well as back-end softwares using 
different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc.

Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser 
and so to learn Javascript you really do not need any special environment setup. 
For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox , Safari and every browser you know as of today, 
supports Javascript.

Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. 
You can develop your website with a console like look and feel and

You can navigate over to different job sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job market.

Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of frameworks and Libraries 
already developed which can be used directly in your software development to reduce 
your time to market.


here are many useful Javascript frameworks and libraries available:

The Javascript world is just too large and too much new is happening.

Applications of Javascript Programming
As mentioned before, Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages 
(Front-end as well as Back-end). It has it's presence in almost every area of software development. 
I'm going to list few of them here:

Client side validation - This is really important to verify any user input before 
submitting it to the server and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.

Manipulating HTML Pages - Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. 
This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify 
your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.

User Notifications - You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages 
to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.

Back-end Data Loading - Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end 
data while you are doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience 
to your website visitors.

Presentations - JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives 
website look and feel. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a 
web-based slide presentations.

Server Applications - Node JS is built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for building fast 
and scalable network applications. This is an event based library which helps 
in developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.

      */
